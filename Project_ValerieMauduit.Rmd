## Presentation of the data

```{r dataset, echo = FALSE}
data("airquality")
```
My App uses **airquality** dataset (`r dim(airquality)[1]` rows):
```{r show, echo=FALSE, eval = TRUE}
head(airquality, 4)
```

We use temperature and wind ranges to forward ozone rate depending on solar rays (only graphically). The questions are:

* When temperature increases, does ozone rate increase? decrease?
* When wind increases, does ozone rate increase? decrease?
* Does ozone increase depending to solar radiation change with other meteoroligal conditions (wind, temperature?)



## What do you see?
Using the sliders (left) you can see how the linear regression ozone depending of solar radiation operates when you wind/temperature ranges changes. It's the red line. For example with wind [1; 10] Mph and temperature [60; 80]°F:
<center>![](W1_10_T60_80_petit.png)</center>

The line coefficients are:
```{r lm, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
subdata <- airquality[airquality$Wind<=10 & airquality$Temp>=60 & 
                          airquality$Temp<=80,]
lm(Ozone ~ Solar.R, data = subdata)$coefficients
```

## Discussion

<div class="columns-2">
- All temperatures, low wind level:
```{r evol1, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
subdata <- airquality[airquality$Wind <= quantile(airquality$Wind, .25),]
lm(Ozone ~ Solar.R, data = subdata)$coefficients
```
- All temperatures, high wind level:
```{r evol2, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
subdata <- airquality[airquality$Wind >= quantile(airquality$Wind, .75),]
lm(Ozone ~ Solar.R, data = subdata)$coefficients
```
- All wind levels, low temperature:
```{r evol3, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
subdata <- airquality[airquality$Temp <= quantile(airquality$Temp, .25),]
lm(Ozone ~ Solar.R, data = subdata)$coefficients
```
- All wind levels, high temperature:
```{r evol4, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
subdata <- airquality[airquality$Temp >= quantile(airquality$Temp, .75),]
lm(Ozone ~ Solar.R, data = subdata)$coefficients
```
</div>

Ozone rate is lower, in mean, when wind is strong or temperature is cold. It is much more depending on solar radiation when low winds.

## Conclusion

To have these coefficients, I use formulas like:

```{r variables, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
wmin <- 1
wmax <- 10
tmin <- 42
tmax <- 80 
```
```{r conclusion, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
subdata <- airquality[airquality$Wind >= wmin & airquality$Wind <= wmax &
                      airquality$Temp >= tmin & airquality$Temp <= tmax,]
lm(Ozone ~ Solar.R, data = subdata)$coefficients
```

I haven't shown them in all slides.

The app provides a graphic answer (red line) but no *lm* coefficients. Up to you to recalculate them.
